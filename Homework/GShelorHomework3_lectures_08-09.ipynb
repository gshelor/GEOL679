    "### Q2. Write a function called `cypher` that makes a _Caesar cypher_, which is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in a string of text is replaced by a different letter positioned some fixed number of characters down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of -3, E would be replaced by B, D would become A, C would be replaced by Z, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who supposedly used it in his private correspondence. The result should be in all uppercase. \n",

    "* A positive shift will shift letters to the right in the alphabet\n",
    "* A negative shift will shift letters to the left in the alphabet\n",
    "* The function should return the shifted new word, in all capital letters.\n",
    "* For simplicity, you may assume that the input string only contains uppercase and lowercase letters (i.e. no numbers or punctuation), and that the shift is between -25 and +25.\n",
