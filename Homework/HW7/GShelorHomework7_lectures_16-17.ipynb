    "In this homework, we will practice our newfound date/time, text parsing, and file I/O skills with real geoscience datasets. The exercise focus on analyzing seismic waveform data from KiK-net, a large array of strong-motion accelerometers in Japan (https://www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp/). The data we will look at is stored in text files that are convenient enough to open and close with a text editor to look at them, but are not so easy to load into Python. This is where your new text parsing skills will come in handy!\n"
